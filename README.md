# PAHAL NGO
Okay, here's a very simple README template focused only on providing a launch button with a placeholder URL.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

Click the button below to visit the deployed website.

[![Launch Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch%20Website-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=firefox-browser)](https://https://pahalngo-uwav.onrender.com)

---

## ðŸš€ Live Demo: A section heading to clearly indicate where the link to the live version is.

Click the button below...: Simple instruction text.

[![Launch Website](...shields.io...)](...): This is the core part:

[![...]]: Makes the shield image clickable.

Launch Website: Alt text for the image (if it fails to load).

https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch%20Website-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=firefox-browser: This URL generates the green button image using shields.io.

Launch%20Website: Text on the left part of the badge.

Click%20Here: Text on the right part.

brightgreen: Color of the badge.

style=for-the-badge: Makes the button larger.

logo=firefox-browser: Adds a small Firefox icon.

(https://your-deployment-url-here.com): This is the link target. It's the URL the user goes to when they click the button. You MUST replace https://your-deployment-url-here.com with your actual website URL.

(Remember to replace...): A comment reminding you (or others) to update the placeholder URL.
